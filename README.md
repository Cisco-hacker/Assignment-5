Task 1: This program creates a dictionary where student names are the keys and their marks are the values. It takes the name of a student from the user, retrieves and displays the corresponding mark if the name is found in the dictionary. Otherwise, it displays: "Student not found."

Task 2: This program first creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10. It then slices the list to extract the first five elements and stores them in a new list. The program reverses the order of the extracted list and finally prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.
